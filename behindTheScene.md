LINE OF ACTION:
** The first thing I will do is to create this api without standard authentication. i.e. with how you can do it right now (I'm brain rusty, at the moment, with my knowledge of JWT and such). So, I will start with what I can recall, and build the app with a freestyle approach.
** Then I'll go ahead to research what I have forgetten.
