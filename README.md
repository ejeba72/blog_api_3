# Blog Api 3

## About this project

This is a project I embarked on, to enable me strengthen my hands at node js express. In this project, I will be writing a blog api, where users and non-users can access a list of published blogs, as well as, read a published blog post of their choice. Furthermore, users can write draft, access only their drafts, publish draft.
